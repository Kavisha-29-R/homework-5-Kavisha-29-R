## 📝 Assignment Overview

### 1. GDP by Country – Stacked Bar Plot  
- Webscrape [Wikipedia – GDP (Nominal)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(nominal)) using Python.  
- Group countries within IMF regions.  
- Generate a **stacked interactive bar plot** using Plotly.  
- Save the plot to an HTML file: `stacked_bar.html`.  

### 2. MRICloud Data – Sankey Diagram  
- Based on the chapter on interactive graphics from [ds4bio book](https://smart-stats.github.io/ds4bio_book/book/_build/html/interactive.html).  
- Display subject MRICloud data as a **Sankey diagram** (minimum 3 levels for Type = 1, starting from intracranial volume).  
- Save the plot to an HTML file: `sankey.html`.  

### 3. Host the Sankey Diagram on GitHub Pages  
- Created a **public repository** on my personal GitHub account (not the classroom repo).  
- Added the Sankey HTML file to that repo.  
- Hosted it via **GitHub Pages**.
